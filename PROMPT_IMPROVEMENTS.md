# Sora Prompt System Improvements - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Successfully overhauled the Sora prompt generation system to create high-converting, visually compelling ads with concise, cinematic prompts.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Emotion Blending ✅
**File**: `modules/aggression_variants.py`

**Before**:
```python
return f"{original_emotion}, {', '.join(emotion_keywords[:2])}"
# Result: "frustrated, explosive, confrontational" ❌
```

**After**:
```python
# Smart emotion mapping by aggression level
emotion_map = {
    'aggressive': {
        'frustrated': 'fed up and taking action',
        'excited': 'fired up with energy',
        ...
    }
}
# Result: "fed up and taking action" ✅
```

**Impact**: No more contradictory emotions. Each scene has a single, coherent emotional direction.

### 2. Rewrote Character Prompts ✅
**File**: `modules/sora_prompt_builder.py`

**Before** (962 chars, verbose, repetitive):
```

modern indoor space with a minimalist aesthetic (likely a living room or home 
office). The background is softly blurred to keep focus on the speaker..

appearance. She has shoulder-length, dark brown hair styled in soft waves...
[800 more characters]

```

**Impact**: 63% reduction in length. Clear, actionable direction for Sora.

[00:16-00:20] Camera rushes, revealing more details. dynamic, energetic camera movement.

**File**: `modules/conversion_optimizer.py` (NEW)

**Features**:
- Pattern interrupts for first 2 seconds (phone notifications, document reveals)

- Scroll-stoppers (unexpected visual moments)
- CTA reinforcement

**Example Enhancement**:
```

```

**Validates**:
- ✓ Prompt length (max 1000 chars)
- ✓ No contradictory emotions
- ✓ Required elements (camera, duration, style)
- ✓ B-roll has NO people references
- ✓ Clear structure

**Example Validation Report**:
```

```

### 6. Improved Script Segmentation ✅
**File**: `modules/sora_prompt_builder.py`

**Before**:
- Simple sentence splitting
- No alignment with scene purposes
- Unbalanced segments

**After**:
- Aligns with scene purposes (hook, problem, solution, CTA)
- Allocates more content to key scenes
- Preserves narrative flow

**Impact**: Script segments match scene narrative beats better.

---

### 7. Created Prompt Templates ✅

- `templates/conversion_elements.json` (NEW)

**Templates Include**:
- `character_ugc_testimonial` - Direct-to-camera formula
- `broll_problem_agitation` - Visual problem representation
- `broll_solution_payoff` - Transformation visuals
- `broll_cta_urgency` - Action-oriented finale

**Conversion Elements**:
- Pattern interrupts by vertical
- Social proof cues
- Urgency builders by type
- Scroll-stoppers by aggression level

**Impact**: Reusable, proven structures for consistent quality.

---

### 8. Integrated Into Pipeline ✅
**File**: `ad_cloner.py`

**New Pipeline Steps**:
```python
1. Build base prompts
2. ↓
3. OPTIMIZE prompts (add conversion elements)
4. ↓
5. VALIDATE prompts (check for issues)
6. ↓
