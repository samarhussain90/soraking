# Sora Transformation - Integration Complete ✅

## What Was Done

The **Sora Ad Transformer** is now fully integrated into the pipeline. Every ad uploaded will automatically be transformed into a Sora-friendly structure that avoids character consistency issues.

---

## Pipeline Flow (Updated)

```
1. Upload Video
   ↓
2. Gemini Analysis (2-3 min)
   → Analyzes original ad structure
   → Extracts script, scenes, spokesperson
   ↓
3. [NEW] Sora Transformation (instant)
   → Detects vertical (auto insurance, health, finance, etc.)
   → Transforms to: 1 character scene + 3 B-roll scenes
   → Replaces scene_breakdown with transformed structure
   ↓
4. Generate Variants
   → Creates aggression variations (soft, medium, aggressive, ultra)
   → Each variant uses transformed structure
   ↓
5. Build Sora Prompts
   → Character scenes: Full spokesperson prompt
   → B-roll scenes: Cinematic visual prompts (NO character)
   ↓
6. Generate with Sora (3-5 min)
   → 4 scenes generated in parallel
   → Only Scene 1 has character (NO consistency issues)
   ↓
7. Assemble Final Video
   → Stitch 4 scenes into complete ad
   ↓
8. Done! Professional, cohesive ad with NO character issues

## Example: Auto Insurance Ad

### Input
- 35-second talking head video
- Woman explaining car insurance savings
- Same person throughout original video

### Old System (Before Transformation)
```
Scene 1 (12s): Woman talking → Generated Person A
Scene 2 (12s): Woman talking → Generated Person B (DIFFERENT!)
Scene 3 (11s): Woman talking → Generated Person C (DIFFERENT AGAIN!)

Result: ❌ 3 different people, confusing, unprofessional
```

### New System (After Transformation)
```
Scene 1 (12s): Woman introducing problem
  → "I was paying $120/month for car insurance..."
  → Generated: ONE consistent person for this scene only

Scene 2 (12s): Car driving on highway (NO PERSON)
  → Aerial tracking shot, sunset lighting
  → "After a quick check, I qualified for $39..."
  → Pure B-roll, no character

Scene 3 (12s): Dash cam near-miss footage (NO PERSON)
  → POV shot, sudden brake, tension
  → "Same coverage, way less money..."
  → Pure B-roll, no character

Scene 4 (12s): Calculator showing savings (NO PERSON)
  → Close-up of numbers, money visual
  → "Click the link below to check if you qualify"
  → Pure B-roll, no character

Result: ✅ Professional, cohesive, NO character issues
```

## Technical Details

### Transformation Logic

**Input**: Original Gemini analysis
```json
{
  "scene_breakdown": [
    {
      "scene_number": 1,
      "timestamp": "00:00-00:35",
      "characters": "Spokesperson",
      "purpose": "Full pitch"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Output**: Transformed analysis
```json
{
  "scene_breakdown": [
    {
      "scene_number": 1,
      "timestamp": "00:00-00:12",
      "type": "spokesperson_hook",
      "has_character": true,
      "spokesperson_description": "...",
      "script_segment": "First 25% of script"
    },
    {
      "scene_number": 2,
      "timestamp": "00:12-00:24",
      "type": "problem_broll",
      "has_character": false,
      "broll_type": "driving",
      "visual_description": "Car driving on highway...",
      "script_segment": "Next 25% of script"
    },
    {
      "scene_number": 3,
      "timestamp": "00:24-00:36",
      "type": "solution_broll",
      "has_character": false,
      "broll_type": "near_miss",
      "visual_description": "Dash cam POV...",
      "script_segment": "Next 25% of script"
    },
    {
      "scene_number": 4,
      "timestamp": "00:36-00:48",
      "type": "cta_broll",
      "has_character": false,
      "broll_type": "savings",
      "visual_description": "Calculator showing...",
      "script_segment": "Last 25% of script"
    }
  ],
  "vertical": "auto_insurance",

}
```

- **Vertical Relevance**: B-roll matches ad topic automatically

### ✅ Automatic
- No manual configuration needed
- Works for any ad type
- Detects vertical automatically

### ✅ Scalable
- Easy to add new verticals
- Just add B-roll templates
- Existing pipeline handles everything

### ✅ Backward Compatible
- If transformation fails, uses original structure
- Graceful degradation
- Error handling built-in

---

## Adding New Verticals

To support a new ad type:

1. Open `modules/sora_transformer.py`
2. Add to `VERTICAL_BROLL` dictionary:

```python
'new_vertical': {
    'name': 'Display Name',
    'scenes': [
        {
            'type': 'scene_type',
            'description': 'Visual description for Sora',
            'mood': 'emotional tone'
        },
        # Add 3-4 B-roll scene templates
    ]
}
```

3. Add detection keywords in `detect_vertical()`:

```python
elif any(word in script for word in ['keyword1', 'keyword2']):
    return 'new_vertical'
```

That's it! The system will automatically use the new templates.
