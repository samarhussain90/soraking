## üé¨ How It Works

### Prompt Composition Flow

```
1. Input: Variant + Script + Vertical + Aggression
                    ‚Üì
2. Text Extractor: Identifies key phrases (prices, hooks, CTAs)
                    ‚Üì
3. Audio Generator: Creates voiceover/music/SFX specs
                    ‚Üì
4. Visual Layer: Multi-shot progression with camera moves
                    ‚Üì
5. Composer: Layers everything into complete Sora 2 Pro prompt
                    ‚Üì
6. Validator: Checks for errors and optimization opportunities
                    ‚Üì
7. Output: Complete prompt with audio, text, and effects
```

### Example Output Prompt Structure

```
[00:00-+03s] EXTREME CLOSE-UP: Phone screen "$120/month" bill.
High-contrast lighting. Frustrated expression.

[+03s-+06s] FAST WHIP PAN to woman's face (mid-20s).
Shallow depth of field. Eye contact with camera.

AUDIO: Female, energetic voice. Emotion: frustrated. Says: "I was paying $120..."
Background music: upbeat electronic, 140 BPM, urgent. Builds from 0:00 to 0:08.
Sound effect at 0:02: whoosh. Sound effect at 0:08: cash register.

TEXT OVERLAYS: At 0:02, pop-in with scale text top-center: "PAYING TOO MUCH?" 
(Impact, 80pt, yellow with black outline). Fades out at 0:05.
At 0:07, crash-in from top: "$39/MONTH" (Bebas Neue, 120pt, red). Stays until 0:12.

TECHNICAL: 4K resolution, 1792x1024, high-energy testimonial, vibrant and punchy, 
cinematic audio mix.
