### 4. ‚≠ê **Final Evaluation & Rating**
Shows Gemini's analysis of the **generated video** with quality scores:

```
OVERALL SCORE: 7.8/10
PREDICTION: GOOD - Should perform well

RATINGS:
- Visual Quality: 8.5/10
- Message Clarity: 7.0/10
- Pacing: 8.0/10
- Storytelling: 7.5/10

COMPARISON:
- Original Vertical: auto_insurance
- Generated Vertical: unknown
- Vertical Match: ‚úó NO
- Scene Count: 5 ‚Üí 3

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. [HIGH] Content does not match original vertical
   Details: Expected auto_insurance content but generated video lacks key terms
   Fix: Strengthen vertical-specific keywords in B-roll prompts

2. [MEDIUM] Pacing too slow
   Details: Slow pacing may lose viewer attention
   Fix: Use 'aggressive' or 'ultra' variant for faster pacing
```

## What This Helps You Debug

### Problem: Generated video doesn't match vertical

**Step 1**: Check **Original Video Analysis** section
- Look for `"vertical": "auto_insurance"`
- Verify it detected the right vertical

**Step 2**: Check **Sora Prompts** section
- Look at Scene 2 (first B-roll scene)
- Verify it contains auto insurance imagery (e.g., "Car driving on highway")
- Check if the prompt says "NO people, NO faces"

**Step 3**: Check **Final Evaluation** section
- Look at "Vertical Match" - should be ‚úì YES
- Read recommendations for specific fixes

### Problem: Character consistency issues

**Step 1**: Check **Ad Transformation** section
- Should show "Character scenes: 1"
- Should show "B-roll scenes: 2 or 3"

**Step 2**: Check **Sora Prompts** section
- Scene 1 should have character description
- Scenes 2-4 should say "NO people, NO faces, NO characters"

### Problem: Sora not following prompts

**Step 1**: Copy the **FULL PROMPT** from **Sora Prompts** section

**Step 2**: Compare to **Final Evaluation** section
- Check "Generated Vertical"
- Read "Generated Analysis" for what Sora actually created

**Step 3**: Adjust prompts if needed based on recommendations
