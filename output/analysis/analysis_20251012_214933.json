She has long, shoulder-length dark brown hair styled in soft waves with subtle lighter brown highlights, parted slightly off-center. Her facial features include large, expressive dark brown eyes, prominent and well-defined dark eyebrows, and a wide, genuine smile revealing straight, white teeth. She has a slender build and is dressed in a casual, relatable style: a plain white, short-sleeved, crew-neck t-shirt and light-wash, high-waisted denim jeans.",
    "speaking_style": "Her tone is highly enthusiastic, friendly, and persuasive. She speaks at a fast but very clear pace, maintaining high energy throughout the video. She makes consistent, direct eye contact with the camera and uses frequent, natural hand gestures to emphasize her points, making her delivery feel authentic and engaging.",

If you've had insurance for 12+ months, don't overpay like I did. Click the link below to check if you qualify. It's fast, free, and could save you hundreds.",
