Her face is expressive with large, bright brown eyes, well-defined dark eyebrows, and a prominent, friendly smile showing straight white teeth. She has a slim to average build. Her attire is casual and relatable: a simple, plain white, short-sleeved crewneck t-shirt paired with light-wash, high-waisted denim jeans.",
    "speaking_style": "Highly energetic, upbeat, and conversational. Her pacing is fast but articulate, delivering information quickly to maintain engagement. She speaks directly to the camera, creating a personal, one-on-one connection. Her tone is enthusiastic and trustworthy, as if sharing an exciting secret with a friend.

If you've had insurance for 12+ months, don't overpay like I did. Click the link below to check if you qualify. It's fast, free, and could save you hundreds.",
