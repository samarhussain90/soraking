    "physical_description": "A female in her early-to-mid 20s with a friendly and approachable appearance. She has an oval face shape with clear, fair-to-olive skin. Her hair is dark brown, shoulder-length, and styled in loose, soft waves with a center part. She has expressive, dark brown eyes, well-defined arched eyebrows, a straight nose, and full lips that are often in a wide, genuine smile. Her build is slender. She is dressed in a casual, relatable style, wearing a simple, form-fitting white crew-neck t-shirt and light-wash, high-waisted blue jeans. No visible jewelry or prominent makeup, contributing to a natural look.",
    "speaking_style": "Her tone is consistently upbeat, enthusiastic, and conversational, as if sharing a helpful tip with a friend. The pace is moderately fast but very clear and articulate, with variations in speed to emphasize key points like dollar amounts. Her energy is high and positive, and she uses open hand gestures and direct eye contact to engage the viewer and build trust.",

If you've had insurance for 12 plus months, don't overpay like I did. Click the link below to check if you qualify. It's fast, free, and could save you hundreds.",

These triggers motivate the viewer to act immediately to avoid a negative outcome (losing money) and achieve a positive one (saving hundreds).",
    "Low Friction CTA: The call to action emphasizes that the process is 'fast' and 'free'. By removing the barriers of time and cost, the ad makes it very easy for the viewer to say 'yes' and click the link."
