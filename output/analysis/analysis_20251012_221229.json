    "physical_description": "A female in her early to mid-20s with a friendly and approachable appearance. She has long, shoulder-length dark brown hair styled in soft waves with subtle lighter brown highlights, parted slightly off-center. Her facial features include large, expressive brown eyes, well-defined arched eyebrows, and a bright, genuine smile with straight white teeth. She has a slender build and is dressed in a casual, relatable style: a simple, form-fitting white crew-neck t-shirt and light-wash, high-waisted denim jeans.",
    "speaking_style": "Highly energetic, upbeat, and enthusiastic. Her tone is conversational and persuasive, as if sharing a valuable secret with a friend. The pace is fast but articulate, with clear enunciation. She uses natural hand gestures to emphasize key points and maintains direct eye contact with the camera, creating a strong sense of connection.",

If you've had insurance for 12 plus months, don't overpay like I did. Click the link below to check if you qualify. It's fast, free, and could save you hundreds.",
