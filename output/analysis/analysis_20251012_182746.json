    "physical_description": "A female in her early-to-mid 20s. She has long, wavy, dark brown hair with subtle lighter brown highlights, parted slightly off-center and styled to frame her face. Her facial features include large, expressive dark brown eyes, thick and perfectly shaped dark eyebrows, and a prominent, friendly smile with very white, straight teeth. She has a clear, fair-to-olive complexion with a defined jawline. Her build is slender. She is dressed in a simple, relatable, casual style: a plain white, short-sleeved, crew-neck t-shirt and light-wash, high-waisted denim jeans.",
    "speaking_style": "Highly energetic, enthusiastic, and friendly. Her tone is conversational and trustworthy, as if sharing a secret with a friend. The pace is fast but articulate, designed to hold attention in a short-form video format. She uses frequent, expressive hand gestures and animated facial expressions (widening eyes, broad smiles) to emphasize her points and convey excitement.",

If you've had insurance for 12+ months, don't overpay like I did. Click the link below to check if you qualify. It's fast, free, and could save you hundreds.",
