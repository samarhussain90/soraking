Her facial features include large, expressive brown eyes, well-defined dark eyebrows, and a wide, friendly smile showing straight white teeth. She has a slim to average body type. She is dressed in a casual, relatable style: a simple, form-fitting white crewneck t-shirt and light-wash, high-waisted blue jeans.",

If you've had insurance for 12+ months, don't overpay like I did. Click the link below to check if you qualify. It's fast, free, and could save you hundreds.",
