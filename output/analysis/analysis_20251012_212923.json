    "The 'Secret' Hook: Framing the discount as a result of a 'new law' that isn't 'automatic' creates a sense of insider knowledge and urgency. It implies that viewers are missing out on something they are entitled to, motivating them to act to claim it. This is more powerful than just saying 'we have low rates.'",

This systematically removes potential barriers (time, cost, complexity) and makes clicking the link feel like a small effort for a potentially large and immediate reward."
