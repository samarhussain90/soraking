    "physical_description": "A female in her early-to-mid 20s with an olive skin tone. She has long, wavy, dark brown hair parted slightly off-center. Her facial features include large, expressive brown eyes, thick, well-defined eyebrows, a straight nose, and a prominent, warm smile with very white teeth. She has a slender, athletic build. Her clothing is casual and relatable: a plain white, short-sleeved, crew-neck t-shirt tucked into high-waisted, light-wash denim jeans. She wears no visible jewelry.",
    "speaking_style": "Her tone is highly enthusiastic, friendly, and confident. The pace of her speech is moderately fast but remains clear and articulate, creating a sense of excitement and urgency. She uses frequent, natural hand gestures for emphasis, such as open palms to present an idea and pointing to highlight key information. Her energy is consistently high and positive, and her facial expressions are very animated, enhancing the relatability of her message.",

If you've had insurance for 12 plus months, don't overpay like I did. Click the link below to check if you qualify. It's fast, free, and could save you hundreds.",

    "**Low-Friction Call to Action:** The CTA emphasizes ease and no cost ('quick two-minute check,' 'fast, free'). This removes psychological barriers, making it easy for the viewer to take the next step since there is seemingly nothing to lose."
