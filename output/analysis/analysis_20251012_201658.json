    "physical_description": "A female in her early-to-mid 20s with a friendly and approachable appearance. She has medium-length, dark brown hair with subtle lighter highlights, styled in soft waves and parted slightly off-center. Her facial features include large, expressive dark brown eyes, prominent and well-defined dark eyebrows, and a wide, genuine smile revealing straight, white teeth. She has a slender build and a clear, fair complexion. Her clothing is casual and relatable: a plain, white, short-sleeved crew-neck t-shirt paired with light-wash, high-waisted denim jeans.",
    "speaking_style": "Highly energetic, enthusiastic, and conversational. Her pace is fast but articulate, delivering lines in a punchy, rhythmic manner. She maintains direct eye contact with the camera and uses subtle hand gestures and head movements to add emphasis and convey excitement. Her tone is persuasive and trustworthy, as if sharing a valuable secret with a friend.",

If you've had insurance for 12+ months, don't overpay like I did. Click the link below to check if you qualify. It's fast, free, and could save you hundreds.",
