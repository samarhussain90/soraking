He wears a black zip-up hoodie with white drawstrings and a blue and white mesh trucker-style baseball cap. He has a friendly, approachable look. \nSpokesperson 2 (Expert/Neighbor): Male, mid-to-late 20s, Caucasian. He has striking light green eyes, short brown hair, and a well-groomed short beard. He is wearing a black Champion brand sweatshirt, a silver curb-link chain necklace, and a black baseball cap with a white front panel. He appears confident and knowledgeable.",
    "speaking_style": "Both spokespeople use a conversational, friendly, and slightly urgent tone. The pace is quick but clear, typical of user-generated content on platforms like TikTok. They speak directly to the camera in a selfie style, creating a personal connection with the viewer. Their energy is high and engaging.",

    "full_transcript": "Voiceover: I'm not supposed to be sharing this with you, so listen closely before it gets taken down. \nSpokesperson 1: So my neighbor's always sitting outside in his Tesla and I was kind of curious how he was able to do this. Well, my wife who's friends with his wife told me about this little secret, so I'm just gonna let him explain it to you. \nSpokesperson 2: Yo, what's up guys? Um, I just figured out how to use the browser on this, so let me pull it up. Um, so if you haven't seen this yet, it's going around Facebook and TikTok. Basically, there's a new solar tax credit program for homeowners. If you own a home and you live in a qualified zip code, they're actually going to just install one of these funky little panels near your house. And in exchange for doing that, they're going to give you an incentive of anywhere from $8,000 to $10,000 into your bank for you. Um, and it will completely eliminate your electric bill as well. So you're saving on your electric bill on top of it. And to qualify, all you got to do is, um, I'll show him how to put a link below this video. You just have to take a free 30-second quiz and let them know what zip code your home is in and you'll find out instantly if you qualify. So, I guess tap the link below now if you want to try it. \nSpokesperson 1: I told you guys.",
