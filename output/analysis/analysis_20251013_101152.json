    "physical_description": "A female in her early-to-mid 20s with a friendly and approachable appearance. She has long, shoulder-length dark brown hair styled in soft waves with subtle lighter brown highlights, parted slightly off-center. Her facial features include large, expressive brown eyes, well-defined arched eyebrows, and a wide, genuine smile revealing straight, white teeth. She has a slender build and is dressed in a casual, relatable style: a simple, plain white, short-sleeved crew-neck t-shirt paired with light-wash, high-waisted denim jeans.",
    "speaking_style": "Her tone is highly enthusiastic, energetic, and persuasive. She speaks at a fast pace but maintains excellent clarity. Her delivery is animated, using frequent, natural hand gestures to emphasize her points and convey excitement. Her facial expressions are very dynamic, mirroring the emotional arc of the script from relatable frustration to triumphant discovery.",
