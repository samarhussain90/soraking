She has shoulder-length, dark brown hair styled in soft waves with subtle lighter brown highlights, parted slightly off-center. Her facial features include large, expressive brown eyes, well-defined but natural-looking eyebrows, and a prominent, wide smile with straight, white teeth. She has a clear complexion and an oval face shape. Her build is slender, and she is dressed in a casual, relatable style: a plain, white, short-sleeved crew-neck t-shirt and light-wash, high-waisted denim jeans.",
    "speaking_style": "Her tone is consistently upbeat, enthusiastic, and highly energetic. She speaks at a fast pace but maintains clear enunciation. Her delivery is persuasive and friendly, using frequent smiles, expressive eye-widening to emphasize points, and natural hand gestures to add dynamism.",

If you've had insurance for 12+ months, don't overpay like I did. Click the link below to check if you qualify. It's fast, free, and could save you hundreds.",
