Y usted no... esta es la mejor parte de esto. Usted no tiene que pagar este dinero siempre y cuando utilice los fondos hacia sus tarjetas de cr\u00e9dito o sus pr\u00e9stamos. De hecho, est\u00e1 en las directrices del programa, as\u00ed que tenlo en cuenta. Ahora bien, si usted va y toma el dinero y lo utiliza en unas vacaciones, usted va a devolverlo. Pero si coges este dinero y lo utilizas para tus tarjetas de cr\u00e9dito o para cualquier pr\u00e9stamo que tengas, no tendr\u00e1s que devolverlo. Es b\u00e1sicamente una manera de restablecer la econom\u00eda porque las cosas se han puesto tan mal, especialmente en los \u00faltimos 12 meses. As\u00ed que echa un vistazo a este programa. En realidad, tengo esta declaraci\u00f3n de Chase Bank. Todo fue perdonado y s\u00ed, en realidad te dan un cheque como este y lo que haces es tomar ese cheque y puedes ponerlo en cualquier tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito que tengas, cualquier pr\u00e9stamo que tengas y no tienes que devolverlo. Pero si usted toma el dinero y lo utilizan para otras cosas, como si usted sale y freaking tomar unas vacaciones o comprar un coche...",
