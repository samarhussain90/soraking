If you've had insurance for 12+ months, don't overpay like I did. Click the link below to check if you qualify. It's fast, free, and could save you hundreds.",

By saying 'don't overpay like I did,' it triggers loss aversion, a powerful psychological motivator. The fact that the discount isn't automatic enhances the fear of missing out if the viewer doesn't act."
